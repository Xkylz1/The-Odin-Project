    <!-- The noopener value prevents the opened link from gaining access to the webpage from which
    it was opened. The noreferrer value prevents the opened link from knowing which webpage or
    resource has a link (or ‘reference’) to it. It also includes the noopener behaviour and thus
    can be used by itself as well. -->

    <!-- Absolute Link (on other web) -->
    <!-- Relativ link ( this web) -->
    <!-- Links to other pages within our own website are called relative links. Relative links
        do not include the domain name, since it is another page on the same site, it assumes
        the domain name will be the same as the page we created the link on. -->

    <a href="page/about.html">About</a>

    <!-- n many cases, this will work just fine; however, you can still run into unexpected issues with this approach. Prepending ./ before the link will in most cases prevent such issues. By adding ./ you are specifying to your code that it should start looking for the file/directory relative to the current directory. -->
